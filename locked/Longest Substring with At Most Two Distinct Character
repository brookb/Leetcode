Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

For example, Given s = “eceba”,

T is "ece" which its length is 3.




















int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(string s) {
        int i = 0, j = -1;
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (int k = 1; k < s.size(); k++) {
            if (s[k] == s[k-1]) continue;
            if (j > -1 && s[k] != s[j]) {
                maxLen = max(maxLen, k - i);
                i = j + 1;
            }
            j = k - 1;
        }
        return maxLen > (s.size() - i) ? maxLen : s.size() - i;
    }
