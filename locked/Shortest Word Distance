Total Accepted: 2444 Total Submissions: 5862 Difficulty: Easy
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.

Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.




















public class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(String[] words, String word1, String word2) {
        int w1 = words.length*2, w2 = words.length,res =words.length; 
        for(int i = 0; i < words.length; i++){
            if(words[i].equals(word1))
                w1 = i;
            if(words[i].equals(word2))
                w2 = i;
            res = Math.min(res,Math.abs(w1-w2));
        }
        return res;
    }
}
