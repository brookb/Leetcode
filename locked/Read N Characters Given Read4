The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function will only be called once for each test case.

int read(char *buf, int n) {
    int res = 0;
    for(int i = 0, curr; i <= n/4 && curr != 0; i++){
        curr = read4(buf + res);
        res += curr;
    }
    return min(res, n);
}
